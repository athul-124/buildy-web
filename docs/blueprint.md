# **App Name**: Thrissur Home Joy

## Core Features:

- Expert Connector: Provide a simple way for Thrissur residents to connect with pre-vetted home service experts (electricians, plumbers, etc.). Add expert ratings + project photos for social proof.
- Emotion-First UX: Present users with a conversational onboarding flow that recommends the best experts to talk to based on the users needs. Use Lottie animations or avatars to make onboarding feel “alive.”
- Instant Consultation: Allow homeowners to book consultations easily with local experts. Add WhatsApp integration for instant confirmation.
- AI-Powered Scheduling: Create an internal tool which uses the user and contractor details and books contractors for the appointments using an LLM to act as a reasoning tool, scheduling based on contractor availability.
- Transparent Pricing: Display transparent, standardized pricing for common services upfront. Add a price range slider or “Why this cost?” explainer next to each price.
- Material Advisor: Offer advice to help customers choose materials (cement, steel, etc.) with focus on quality and fair price. Add video/audio tips from experts (build trust + SEO).

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a calm, trust-based palette — light blue, pastel green, and white.
- Clean and spacious layout - add ghost buttons, progressive disclosure.
- Use Inter or Work Sans — highly readable.
- Add a visual consistency framework (e.g., Lucide icons + Feather).
